    "This algorithm is based on the greedy algorithm. Let's explain the greedy algorithm. To find subsistence of sequence S that is equal to the word W, we are looking at the characters in the string S in turn and compare them with the first character of word w. After the first character of w is found we are searching the second character of the word in the unviewed part of the string. If we found all characters of the word w in the string S in the right order w is a substring of the S. If w is a substring of the string S greedy algorithm will find it. The running time of this algorithm is O(N) where N is a length of the string S. "
